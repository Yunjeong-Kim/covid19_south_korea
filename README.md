# COVID-19 in South Korea
This repository is for the COVID-19 in South Korea mapping project for "Data Science for Public Health 1" at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

# App

We have two sections in our app. The first section is an interactive map which shows all COVID-19 testing centers in South Korea, and the second section is the statistics of cumulative, daily and released cases in South Korea from January to current time.

  * Data source
  
  We have two sections in our app. The first section is an interactive map which shows all testing centers in South Korea. The data were scrapped from Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare[https://www.mohw.go.kr/react/popup_200128_2.html?fbclid=IwAR0naRh5ksc0Vj7HUOboJmf1WLRx2EKV6YnNs_5ns4MJ6YQ2-JzyVwEHNA0]. We added the GPS data (latitude and longitude) of each testing center based on google map. We color-coded the testing centers according to COVID-19 testing availability and also included detailed information of each testing center. 

  ## Statistics 
  * Data source
  The data were extracted from [DC4C (Data Science for COVID19)](https://github.com/jihoo-kim/Data-Science-for-COVID-19) and edited with additional data from [Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention(KCDC)](https://www.cdc.go.kr/cdc_eng/)
